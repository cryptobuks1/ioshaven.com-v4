  <p>It has come to our attention that many of our users are concerned about the topic of Net Neutrality. We have provided a few links as well as more information of our own to help persuade you to take action. </p>

  <div class="h3">What is Net Neutrality?</div>
  <p>Net Neutrality is the push for a fair internet in the US. With a fair and neutral internet, people like you and me can browse the web equally.</p>
  <p>So what is the problem? The problem is Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are trying to create premium internet. If you do not pay enough money, your internet could theoretically be limited to a specific selection of websites. This means your favorite websites could be blocked.</p>

  <p>Don't let the powerful congressmen and business owners control us? Otherwise, this is what could happen:</p>
  <ul class="m-0 p-0">
    <li class="text">Slow down Internet speeds to your favorite sites. (Netflix, YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, IOS Haven, etc.) </li>
    <li class="text">Block content.</li>
    <li class="text">Create "Fast Lanes". Meaning you have to pay extra to access specific sites or get decent Internet speeds.</li>
  </ul>

  <div class="h3">Do Your Part</div>
  <p>We have provided a few useful links that we think you should look at. The links include ways to contact your representatives as well articles covering the topic. <strong>If you have any more questions, contact us. We will be happy to answer your questions.</strong></p>

    <h2>What is Net Neutrality? </h2>

    <p>Simply put, Net Neutrality allows users across the internet to be free. With Net Neutrality, users can browse the web equally, which is a good thing. The problem is, Internet Service Providers (ISPs) like Comcast and Verizon want to prevent equality and freedom across the web. If Comcast and Verizon win the battle, they could theoretically do the following:</p>
